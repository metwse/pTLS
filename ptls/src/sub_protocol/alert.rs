//!
//! pTLS provided an [`Alert`] protocol to indicate key update, closure
//! information and errors. Unlike [`ApplicationData`], alert messages may not
//! encrypted.
//!
//! Alert messages describe the alert and include an 8-bit integer indicating
//! whether the error is fatal and if the message is encrypted.
//!
//! Alerts sent before the `handshake` phase are unencrypted, while errors
//! after the `handshake` phase must be sent encrypted. All unencrypted alerts
//! are ignored after a successful [`Finished`] or [`EncryptedClientHello`]
//! phase in the `handshake`.
//!
//! [`Finished`]: Handshake::Finished
//! [`EncryptedClientHello`]: Handshake::EncryptedClientHello
